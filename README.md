## 🚀 About The Project

Piggino was born from the need for a financial tracking tool that combines a simple user experience with powerful features. More than just a spreadsheet, Piggino is a complete web application built on a modern, scalable, and production-ready architecture.

Version 1.0 is fully functional and deployed, offering users the essential tools to take control of their finances with clarity and purpose.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Tech Stack

Piggino is built with a containerized microservices architecture, leveraging modern technologies and DevOps best practices to ensure scalability, security, and an agile development cycle.

### Solution Architecture

* **Backend API (.NET):** A robust RESTful API built with ASP.NET 8, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with a clear separation of concerns (Controllers, Services, Repositories).
* **Frontend SPA (React):** A modern and reactive Single-Page Application developed with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a fast and fluid user experience.
* **Database:** Utilizes SQLite for simplicity and portability, managed via Entity Framework Core.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire infrastructure is defined and orchestrated through a `docker-compose.yml` file, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.
* **Reverse Proxy (Caddy):** Caddy is used as the reverse proxy to manage all incoming traffic, route requests to the appropriate frontend and backend services, and automate the generation and renewal of SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.
* **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** A fully automated continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline. Every push to the `main` branch triggers a workflow that builds the Docker images, pushes them to Docker Hub, and updates the application in production with zero downtime.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

This project follows a GitFlow-like branching model to ensure code stability in production:

-   `main`: Contains the stable, production-ready code. Only accepts merges from the `develop` branch. Every merge to `main` triggers the deployment pipeline.
-   `develop`: The main development branch where all new features are integrated before being released.
-   `feature/*`: Short-lived branches created from `develop` to build new features in isolation.
