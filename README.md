# 🐷 Piggino

**Piggino** is a personal finance tracking system designed to be **simple**, **friendly**, and **evolutionary**.  
It helps users manage income, expenses, credit card installments, and payment reminders — all in an intuitive and customizable experience.

> 💡 **Why “Piggino”?**  
> The name combines "**piggy**" (as in *piggy bank*) with the Italian-style suffix "**-ino**", giving it a warm, friendly tone.  
> Think of Piggino as your **personal digital piggy bank** — always there to help you grow your financial awareness.
